A plugin for Salesforce which breaks up large metadata files (XML) into smaller files for version control, including custom labels, workflows, permission sets, profiles, and a lot more.

### [xml-disassembler](https://github.com/mcarvin8/xml-disassembler)

A JavaScript package which can break down any XML file into smaller files for easier review and maintenance, then reassemble them as needed.

### [apex-code-coverage-transformer](https://github.com/mcarvin8/apex-code-coverage-transformer)

A plugin for Salesforce which creates Apex Code Coverage XML files compatible for SonarQube.

### [apex-tests-git-delta](https://github.com/mcarvin8/sfdx-decomposer-plugin)
